# OmniFocus Plugins

By [Josh Hughes](http://josh-hughes.com)

This is (hopefully/probably) the beginning of a collection of plugins for OmniFocus. There's one so far:

- **Set Review Date**: A plugin that prompts you for a date, and makes that date the new review date for all projects.

## Installation Instructions

- Be using at least OmniFocus 3.8 (currently in [testing](https://www.omnigroup.com/test/)), or at least 3.4 after setting this hidden setting: `omnifocus:///change-preference?OJSEnabled=1` (paste it into your browser's URL bar, and then restart OmniFocus).
- [Download and unzip this repository](https://github.com/deaghean/omnifocus-plugins/archive/master.zip).
- **On Mac**: Go to **Automation** > **Plug-Ins...**, and right-click on either "On My Mac" or "OmniFocus in iCloud Drive" and choose "Reveal in Finder". Move the SetReviewDate.omnifocusjs file to that folder.
- **On iOS**: The plugin options are all under **Settings** > **Configure Plug-Ins**, but placing the SetReviewDate.omnifocusjs file in iCloud Drive in the **OmniFocus** > **Plug-Ins** folder should do the trick.
