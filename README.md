# OmniFocus Plugins

By [Josh Hughes](http://josh-hughes.com)

This is the beginning of a collection of plugins for OmniFocus.

- **Set Review Date**: (SetReviewDate.omnifocusjs) A plugin that prompts you for a date, and makes that date the new review date for all projects. Note: If you're using this on the Mac, and edit the text of the date rather than using the date picker, hit Return to confirm rather than clicking "Select Date". There's a known issue with OmniFocus where it might not recognize the date change otherwise.
- **Toggle Tag**: (ToggleTag.omnijs) Allows you to toggle a tag on tasks and projects, with an option to remove sibling tags on add if you have a tag group where you would like there to be only one of the set. You can duplicate this plugin multiple times for multiple tags.
- **Generate Toggle Tag Plugin**: (GenerateToggleTagPlugin.omnijs) This plugin generates a Toggle Tag plugin that contains your entire tag library as options.

## Installation Instructions

- Be using OmniFocus 3.8+ Professional.
- [Download and unzip this repository](https://github.com/deaghean/omnifocus-plugins/archive/master.zip).
- **On Mac**: Go to **Automation** > **Plug-Ins...**, and right-click on either "On My Mac" or "OmniFocus in iCloud Drive" and choose "Reveal in Finder". Move the plugin files you want to that folder.
- **On iOS**: The plugin options are all under **Settings** > **Configure Plug-Ins**, but placing the plugin files in iCloud Drive in the **OmniFocus** > **Plug-Ins** folder should do the trick.
