# OmniFocus Plugins

By [Josh Hughes](http://josh-hughes.com)

This is (hopefully/probably) the beginning of a collection of plugins for OmniFocus. There's one so far:

- **Set Review Date**: A plugin that prompts you for a date, and makes that date the new review date for all projects.

Feedback and suggestions are welcome, and I'm happy to answer any questions. I can be reached at [josh@josh-hughes.com](mailto:josh@josh-hughes.com).
